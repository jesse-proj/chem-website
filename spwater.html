					<h1> Structure and Properties of Water </h1>
					<h2> Properties of Water </h2>
					<p><b> Immiscibility </b></p>
					<p> Immiscibility is the property where two substances cannot combine to form a homogenous mixture. The experiment shows immiscibility as all the fluids do not mix and dissolve into each other, allowing them to form distinct layers. </p> 
					<div style = 'text-align: center;'>
						<img class = 'example-diagram' src = 'media/diagrams/immiscible.png'/>
						<p> Example of immiscible liquids. </p>
					</div>
					<p><b> Surface Tension </b></p>
					<p> Surface tension is the tendency of fluid surfaces to shrink into the minimum surface area possible. Surface tension can be observed on the soap bubble. Concerning the experiment, the tomato remained suspended on the dishwashing soap due to its density relative to surrounding the liquids. The tomato is consequently suspended within the dishwashing soap layer rather than sinking or floating. More details about surface tension and its role in the experiment can be found <a href = 'surface-tension.html'><b>here.</b></a></p>

					</div>
					<p><b> Buoyancy </b></p>
					<p> Buoyancy is an object's tendency to float or rise in a fluid when submerged. This fluid can be either a liquid or a gas. This can also apply to the metal screw that shrinks at the bottom of the Density Column. The metal screw density is higher than the surrounding fluids. As a result, the screw displaces a volume of liquid with a weight greater than its weight, leading to a net upward force exerted by the fluid on the screw. This buoyant force is not sufficient to lift the screw against gravity, so the screw remains at the bottom of the jar. (Figure 4)This also goes with the plastic bottle cup and the ping pong ball. The cup has a lower density than the vegetable oil, so the object stays at the top of the oil. (Figure 5); the ping pong ball also has a lower density than the lamp oil, which makes that ping pong ball stay at the top of the lamp oil (Figure 6). Consequently, objects with lower density will float on the top of liquids with higher density.  </p>

					<h2> Application in the experiment: </h2>
					<p><b> Honey - greatest density (1.42 g/mL)</b></p>
					<p> Honey is an organic, natural sugar alternative with no additives that is easy on the stomach, adapts to all cooking processes, and has an indefinite shelf-life. It is made by bees and stored in wax structures called honeycombs. Bees produce honey by gathering and then refining the sugary secretions of plants, primarily floral nectar, or the secretions of other insects, like the honeydew of aphids. 
					</p>
					<p><b> Corn syrup - high density (1.33 g/mL)</b></p>
					<p> Corn syrup is a viscous, sweet syrup made from the naturally occurring sugars in corn. There are two main varieties of corn syrup: light and dark. Light corn syrup is transparent, often vanilla-flavored, and milder in sweetness, while dark corn syrup features molasses, resulting in a deeper, richer sweetness and caramel coloring. As you look into the experiment, it uses dark corn syrup.  
					</p>
					<p><b> Dish Soap - moderate to high density (1.06 g/mL)</b></p>
					<p> Dish soap is a specialized form of soap that contains a mixture of surfactants — substances designed to break the tension between solids, that are especially high-foaming and chosen because they do not irritate the skin. This special mixture of surfactants is what makes dish soap so effective at cutting oils and grease on dishes and pots.
					</p>
					<p><b> Water - moderate density (1.00 g/mL)</b></p>
					<p> Water, chemical formula: H2O, is a transparent fluid which forms the world's streams, lakes, oceans and rain, and is the major constituent of the fluids of organisms. As a chemical compound, a water molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms that are connected by covalent bonds.
					</p>
					<p><b> Vegetable Oil - moderate density - (0.92 g/mL)</b></p>
					<p> Vegetable oil is a mild, odorless, flavorless, light-colored cooking oil that is good for cooking, frying and for making salad dressings. Any oil made from plants, whether it's derived from seeds, grains, nuts or fruits, is considered a vegetable oil. But when you see a bottle of oil labeled "vegetable oil," it's almost always soybean oil.
					</p>
					<p><b> Isopropyl alcohol - low density - (0.79 g/mL)</b></p>
					<p> Isopropyl alcohol commonly referred to as Isopropanol or n-propanol or dimethylcarbinol is a colorless and flammable liquid with the formula C3H8O. Isopropyl alcohol is widely employed in solvent applications.
					</p>
					<p><b> Lamp Oil - low density - (0.81 g/mL)</b></p>
					<p> Lamp oil is a refined fuel specifically designed for use in oil lamps. It burns cleanly, producing a steady, bright flame ideal for lighting. Typically derived from petroleum, it can also be made from plant-based sources. In the same family as kerosene, it has been further processed and refined so that it doesn't produce as much harmful smoke, soot, and other pollutants.
