					<h1> Surface Tension </h1>
					<p> Surface Tension is a property of the liquid surface to resist external forces. This phenomenon can be observed in the near-spherical shapes of small droplets (Figure 1). The phenomenon is a result of different forces between molecules in liquids, creating an inward force at the surface as if it was a “skin” or tension at the surface to minimize the liquid’s surface area (Figure 2).  </p>

							Layer 1: <i> Honey </i>
							</p>
						<p style = 'float: left;'> Honey is known for its significant thickness, or viscosity, which impacts its surface tension, typically ranging from 50 to 70 millinewtons per meter. Due to this high viscosity, honey tends to settle towards the bottom when compared to other liquids, creating the perception of it being denser or heavier.  </p>
						
						<p class = 'subtext'> 
							Layer 2: <i> Corn Syrup </i>
							</p>
							<p style = 'float: left;'> Corn syrup generally has a surface tension falling between 45 and 60 millinewtons per meter, indicating a lower viscosity compared to honey. This variance in thickness results in corn syrup floating atop honey when the two substances are layered, as honey's higher viscosity causes it to settle below the less viscous corn syrup.  </p>
						
						<p class = 'subtext'> 
							Layer 3: <i> Dish Soap </i>
							</p>
							<p style = 'float: left;'> The density of the dishwashing soap is 1.03 g/mL. Dish soap works as a surfactant, reducing the surface tension of water. When you add soap, it interferes with the strong connections between water molecules, causing a drop in surface tension. This decrease allows the soap to spread out and create a distinct layer above the others. The resistance forms a boundary, keeping the layers separate and clearly visible. This boundary is essential for the formation of distinct layers in the density column, allowing for a visually captivating effect.</p>
						
						<p class = 'subtext'> 
							Layer 4: <i> Water Mixed with Red Food Coloring </i>
							</p>
							<p style = 'float: left;'> During this layer, surface tension acts in a slightly different way than with the dish soap layer. Water and food coloring have the same density. With a density of 997 kg/m^3 or roughly 1 gram per milliliter. In the density column, it helps water droplets form and stick to the container's surface because of the attraction between water molecules. Eventually, this process continues until gravity overcomes surface tension. So it keeps the water layer separate from the layer below, creating different layers in the column and showing how important it is in controlling liquid behavior. </p>
						
						<p class = 'subtext'> 
							Layer 5: <i> Vegetable Oil </i>
							</p>
							<p style = 'float: left;'> The density of vegetable oil varies with temperature and what kind of vegetable oil it is. It ranges from 0.91 to 0.93cm^3 and between 15°C to 25°C compared to water that has a density of 1.00 gm/ml. Since vegetable oil is lighter it forms a separate layer on top of the water because of the vegetable oil’s lower density.</p>
						
						<p class = 'subtext'> 
							Layer 6: <i> 91% Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) with food coloring </i>
							</p>
							<p style = 'float: left;'> The density of the isopropyl alcohol (IPA) is 0.87 - 88 g/cm3, having a lighter density than vegetable oil, IPA rests on top of the vegetable oil. Having a concentration of 91% it has a lesser density than lower concentrated IPA. Factors such as temperature and impurities can affect its density as well.</p>
						
						<p class = 'subtext'> 
							Layer 7: <i> Lamp Oil with coloration </i>
							</p>
							<p style = 'float: left;'> Lamp Oil has a density of 0.81 g/cm3 or g/mL being less dense than the alcohol, the lamp oil naturally sits on top of IPA. While having coloration may affect its behavior and appearance, it does not impact its density, even with coloration it would still rest on top of the density column.</p>
