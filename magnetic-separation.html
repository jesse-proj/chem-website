					<h1>  Viscosity </h1>
					<p> Viscosity is the resistance of fluid to flow. It is the thickness or thinness of a fluid. Higher the viscosity means low flow of fluid. Viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow. It describes the internal frictional force that opposes the relative motion of adjacent layers of fluid as they move past each other. In simpler terms, viscosity determines how easily a fluid can flow.</p>

					<p style = 'float: left;'> In the experiment, a seven-layer density column was created by layering different liquids of varying densities on top of each other. The layers were arranged from most dense at the bottom to least dense at the top. The liquids used were honey, corn syrup, Dawn dish soap, water, vegetable oil, isopropyl alcohol, and lamp oil. </p>

					<p style = 'float: left;'> Now, let's talk about viscosity. Viscosity refers to a fluid's resistance to flow. A fluid with high viscosity is thick and flows slowly, while a fluid with low viscosity is thin and flows quickly. In the density column experiment, each layer had its own viscosity, which contributed to the behavior of objects dropped into the column. Here's how the viscosity likely varied across the layers</p>
					<p style = 'float: left;'> Honey (Bottom Layer): Honey is highly viscous, meaning it has a high resistance to flow and it has the highest viscosity among the seven density columns.That is the reason why it is in the bottom of the density jar. Correlationally, it has the slowest flow rate. </p>
					<p style = 'float: left;'> Corn Syrup: Corn syrup is also quite viscous which means having thick consistency and high viscosity , although slightly less so than honey. It has a similar thick consistency, so the screw likely encountered significant resistance as it passed through this layer.</p>
					<p style = 'float: left;'> Dawn Dish Soap: Dish Dawn soap typically has a lower viscosity compared to honey and corn syrup. It is still somewhat thick but not as dense. The grape tomato dropped into this layer likely experienced some resistance but was able to sink relatively quickly until it came to Dish Dawn soap stopping the grape  tomato.</p>
					<p style = 'float: left;'>Water: Water has a relatively low viscosity compared to the previous layers. It flows more easily and has less resistance. The cup floating to the top of the water layer demonstrates that its density was lower than that of water. </p>
					<p style = 'float: left;'>Vegetable Oil: Vegetable oil has a higher viscosity than water but lower than honey and corn syrup. It's less dense than water, so the cup rose to the top of this layer. </p>
					<p style = 'float: left;'> Isopropyl Alcohol: Using 91% isopropyl alcohol in the experiment served two key purposes. Firstly, its specific density fits well within the required range for the experiment, being less dense than the layers below it but denser than the layers above it. This concentration was likely selected for its optimal density within the experiment's constraints. Secondly, the 91% concentration of isopropyl alcohol also implies a lower water content, which generally results in a lower viscosity compared to lower concentrations. As a result, this lower viscosity facilitated the formation of a distinct layer in the density column and influenced the behavior of objects within it.</p>
					<p style = 'float: left;'> Lamp Oil (Top Layer): Lamp oil likely has a low viscosity and is less dense than the layers below it. The ping pong ball rested on top of this layer so we know that it was the least dense layer in the column.</p>
					<p style = 'float: left;'> Overall, the viscosity of each layer contributed to the behavior of objects dropped into the density column, affecting how quickly they sank or floated and how much resistance they encountered as they moved through the layers.</p>
